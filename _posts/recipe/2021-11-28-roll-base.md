Roll Base
=========

[1]: notes/gim
[2]: notes/rice

Ingredients
-----------

- [x] __gim__ - The amount of rolls you want to make plus like two more for when your hand gets stuck to the rice and you tear your roll in half.[1]
 This may be available as "gim for gimbap" but you will probably find it as nori, the japanese name. The biggest issue will be storage of extra sheets. Any extra sheets (usually comes in a 10 pack) should be stored flat in a ziplock bag with the air evacuated. If moisture or air get in contact with these they can develop some off flavors pretty quickly. 
- [x] __cooked rice__ - Any white rice will work.[2]
- [ ] __toasted seasame oil__ - If you want everything you touch to smell like toasted seasame seeds for the rest of the day. This is pretty widely available and mostly adds a nice smell. It also maybe helps make the rice easier to work with.
- [ ] __salt__ -
