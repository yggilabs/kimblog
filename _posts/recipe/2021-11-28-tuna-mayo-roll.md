Tuna Mayo Roll
==============

Some days I want something new; today I want something familiar. One of my all time favorite kimbap fillings is also one of the simplest.

Ingredients
-----------

- [x] __roll base__ - This is a normal roll of gimbab. [Directions](#roll-base)
- [x] __tuna__ - The amount you need to justify the amount of mayo that you want in each roll. The tuna needs to be completely dry. This is structural tuna in our roll. Don't just drain the tuna, wring it out in a paper towel. If you skip this step you will have tuna oozing everywhere.
- [X] __mayonnaise__ - I gave up on trying to figure out how much mayonaise people think is the right amount, you know the right amount. It is possible to find to find Korean style mayonaise under the Ottogi or Kewpie (Japanese) brands in asian markets. The major difference is that they use only egg yolk I guess. It's not a big deal; honestly, you can go as far as to use Miracle Whip if thats you thing.
- [ ] Toasted Seasame Oil - If you want everything you touch to smell like toasted seasame seeds for the rest of the day. This is pretty widely available and mostly adds a nice smell. It also maybe helps make the rice easier to work with.
- [ ] Vegtables - I'm pretty sure the neon yellow pickled radish is more sugar that vegtable so don't go feeling like I'm being healthy. You are welome to try more healthy options like: shredded ieberg, sprouts, bell pepper, tomato, shreded cucumber or carrot, provolone cheese (cheese is a very concentrated vegtable).

Step 1: Prepare the base. Put rice on you
