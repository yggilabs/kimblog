Tuna Mayo Roll
==============

Some days I want something new; today I want something familiar. One of my all time favorite kimbap fillings is also one of the simplest. With only 4 ingredients this is a must try.

Ingredients
-----------

- [x] __kim sheets__ - The amount of rolls you want to make plus like two more for when your hand gets stuck to the rice and you tear your roll in half 
- [x] __cooked rice__ - Any white rice will work. I am not respinsible for anything that happens if you attempt to use brown rice.
- [x] __canned or pouched tuna__ - The amount you need to justify the amount of mayo that you want in each roll
- [X] __mayonaise__ - I gave up on trying to figure out how much mayonaise people think is the right amount, you know the right amount
- [ ] Toasted Seasame Oil - If you want everything you touch to smell like toasted seasame seeds for the rest of the day.
- [ ] Pickled Radish - I'm pretty sure this is more sugar that vegtable so don't go feeling like you are being healthy.
